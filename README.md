# Kaggle Boat Classification with CNN

Kaggle Boat Classification challenge using a custom CNN to classify ships into 10 categories.

Context

This notebook addresses the Kaggle Boat Classification Challenge, where the objective is to classify boats into 10 distinct categories using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The model is built from scratch with a focus on simplicity and efficiency, utilizing fewer than 30 layers to achieve competitive performance in the competition.

Key Points:
- Custom CNN: Built manually without using pre-trained models.
- Kaggle Competition: Designed to meet the requirements of the boat classification challenge.
- Goal: To classify images of boats into 10 categories with high accuracy.
